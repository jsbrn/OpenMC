§2§lWelcome to OpenMC!§0
§3(No world resets!)§0

§9§nhttps://openmc.net§0

§0You have spawned by yourself in a random area. You are free to start playing, but you'll want to read this book first, so you know how it works.§0

==========================

§lClaiming Land§r

Place a banner down to claim (§2and protect§0) a 50x50x50 plot of land.

You can buy more plots with Emeralds in the Capital City.

Use §6/plots§0 to list your plots.§0

==========================

§lFriends§r

To add a trusted player as a friend, use §6/friend §6§ousername§0.

They will be able to build on your plots, and you will see them in chat wherever they are.§0

==========================

§lChat§r

By default, you can only see chat messages from nearby players and friends.

Use §6/global §6§oon/off§0 to toggle public chat. To send a public message, use §6/g §6§omessage§0.
 §0

==========================

§lPlayer Reputation§r

If you attack another player or steal/damage their property, you will lose reputation. If your reputation drops below §4-100§0, you will be temporarily banned.

Reputation increases over time.§0

==========================

§lThe Capital§r

The Capital City is located at the center of the world.

You can buy and sell goods at the §lmarket§r, buy more land plots at the §lcourthouse§r, bet on fights in the §larena§r, and more.§0

==========================

All players spawn within 3000 blocks of it, and the compass will always point to it.§0

==========================

§lServer Funding§r

OpenMC is pay-as-you-play. Players can purchase more server time on the §9§nwebsite§0.

The goal is to increase the quality and dedication of the community (and keep the server alive).

 §0

==========================

I recognize that this might alienate some players, but I think it's an essential step in ensuring the quality of the server, by challenging players to put their money where their mouse is, so to speak.
 §0

==========================

Check out the §9§nwebsite§0 to learn more about it, and if you have any questions or feedback you can message me (Computerology) there as well.§0

==========================

§lPermits§r

You will need a permit from the Capital to use TNT, elytras and redstone. This is to keep the lag down to a minimum.

You can buy these at the Capital for Emeralds.
 §0

==========================

§lMiscellaneous§r

- get more server time by having the highest reputation or recruiting new players
- sleep in a bed at night to add 1 hour to the world time
- the §9§nwebsite§0 has player stats, information and even a live map!
